        <h2 class="heading">Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the noodles:</strong> Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil and, once boiling, cook pasta according to package instructions. Begin preparing chicken while pasta cooks. Before draining, reserve 1 cup of pasta water. Set pasta aside and keep warm.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the chicken:</strong> Season chicken all over with a sprinkling of salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Add oil to a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat until oil is shimmering. Add chicken, searing on each side (about 3-4 minutes per side, chicken should be golden brown). Once cooked through (internal temperature of chicken should be 165F/74C), remove to a plate and cover plate with foil to keep warm.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the Alfredo sauce:</strong> Wipe out pan if needed. Add the butter to the pan and heat over medium-heat until melted.</li>
                <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Slowly whisk in cream until combined, then cook, continuing to whisk (don’t allow it to boil) until sauce is beginning to thicken (about 5 minutes).</li>
                <li>Add parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and nutmeg and stir until cheese is melted. Stir until thoroughly combined. Taste-test and add additional spices if needed.</li>
                <li>Add pasta to the sauce along with a splash (about 2-4 Tablespoons) of the reserved pasta water. Stir well and cook over low heat, stirring, until sauce clings to the noodles. Return chicken to the pan.</li>
                <li>Serve warm, topped with fresh parsley for garnish, if desired.</li>
            </ol>
