    <h2 class="heading">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set the oven to 350F</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Italian Sausage:</strong>  Saute onions in olive oil over medium heat in a large pan or skillet until softened, 4 minutes. Add garlic and stir in for a minute. Add ground beef, pork, salt, pepper, oregano, sage, fennel, smoked paprika and red pepper flakes (if using).  Stir regularly, incorporating the spices into the meat for 7- 8 minutes until the meat browns.</li>
            <li><strong>Meat Sauce:</strong> Add 3 cups of the marinara sauce and the broth to the browned meat. (Reserve two cups of plain marinara for the bottom and very top of the lasagna.) Cover, simmer five minutes and remove from heat.  You’ll have 4 ½-5 cups of meat sauce.  <strong>Tip:</strong> Taste; if it tastes acidic, add 1-2 teaspoons of sugar or honey to taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese Filling:</strong> In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta, egg, salt, nutmeg and pepper. Add 1 & 1/2 cups of grated mozzarella and 1/2 cup of grated parmesan (we aren’t adding all of the cheese here-saving part of the cheese for the top) and stir until combined.  Save the remaining cheese for the top of the lasagna. </li>
            <li><strong>Assemble Lasagna:</strong> Spread one cup of the reserved marinara on the bottom of a greased 9 x 13 pan. Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly on the noodles, the spread 1 ½ cups of the meat sauce. Repeat this layering sequence 2 more times, pressing down lightly with each layer. </li>
            <li><strong>For the top layer,</strong> place the last of the lasagna noodles, spread the remaining reserved marinara over the noodles, sprinkle with parmesan, and lastly, sprinkle with the mozzarella.  </li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover with parchment paper and aluminum foil, so the foil doesn’t touch the lasagna. Bake in the middle of the oven for 45 minutes or until bubbling. Uncover and bake for 15 more minutes until golden.  Optional: Broil for  3-5 minutes until cheese gets bubbly and brown, keep a close eye!</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
